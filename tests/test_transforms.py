"""
Tests for JAX transformations on NUFFT functions.

Tests cover:
- JIT compilation (jax.jit)
- Reverse-mode autodiff (jax.grad, jax.vjp)
- Forward-mode autodiff (jax.jvp)
- Vectorization (jax.vmap)
- Higher-order derivatives (jax.hessian)
- Combinations of transforms

NOTE: Tests to be implemented once core NUFFT functions are complete.
